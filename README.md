Heavily inspired by this [Japanese conjugation practice tool](https://github.com/baileysnyder/japanese-conjugation) made by Bailey Synder.  
Also credits to Fred Jehle who created an open [conjugation database](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs) with over 600 verbs.

## Features
- The options panel features some control about the randomizer like only allowing specific tenses or pronouns for more specialized training.
- By default, you can use double vowel for accents (e.g. `ee` = `é`, `uu` = `ú`, etc)

## Future Plans

1) Add more tenses and verbs
2) Add some more options
