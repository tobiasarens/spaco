# Spanish Conjugation Practice - SpaCo

Small project to practice spanish conjugation. 
Have a simple web-frontend that shows a verb, a tense and asks for the correct form.

Heavily inspired by this [Japanese conjugation practice tool](https://github.com/baileysnyder/japanese-conjugation) made by Bailey Synder.
