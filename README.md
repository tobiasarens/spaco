Small project to practice spanish conjugation. 
Have a simple web-frontend that shows a verb, a tense and asks for the correct form.

The options panel features some control about the randomizer like only allowing specific tenses or pronouns for more specialized training.

Heavily inspired by this [Japanese conjugation practice tool](https://github.com/baileysnyder/japanese-conjugation) made by Bailey Synder.  
Also credits to Fred Jehle who created an open [conjugation database](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs) with over 600 verbs.
